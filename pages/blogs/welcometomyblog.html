            <p>Sup.</p>
            <p>I don't really have a plan for this website, so we'll have to see where 
                it goes. I'd like to do some media review on here (hence the review section 
                in the navigation menu), but even that I'm not sure of since I'm not usually 
                good on summarizing my thoughts on something into words.
            </p>
            <p>At the time of starting this website I'm learning computer science at a 
                University. I'm not sure if I like it, but I'm too far in to give up now. 
                It's not that computers are boring to me (in fact I don't think they ever 
                will be), I'm just not sure I'm a fan of hyperfocusing on minor details to 
                optimize memory usage and efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>I'd much rather spend my time talking about cooler things like music and 
                movies and video games and having fun. There's so much to see and do in the 
                world and it gets overwhelming, but I think that's where you find the most 
                beauty.
            </p>
            <p>I want to learn another language. I want to travel to foreign countries. 
                I want to meet people that I'd never be friends with. I want to hear people's 
                stories and talk to them. Some day I think I'll be able to do these 
                things, but I'm not sure when and I wish it was now.
            </p>
            <p>I'm sure this won't be the last time I talk about this on here, but idk how 
                often I'll get personal on here, since this is the internet and I don't fw 
                revealing myself online.
            </p>
            <p>I think the things I've said in this blog entry are pretty basic, and I think 
                I'll keep it that way. I think it's all the information you really need to 
                know about me, if you even need any information at all.
            </p>
            <p>Anyways, thanks for visiting. If you feel like contacting me or being 
                friends or you think something is wrong with my website and want to let me 
                know, reach out to me on one of my socials listed at the <a href="../socials.html">
                Social Media Links</a> section of this webpage. Who knows, you might end up 
                on the <a href="../friends.html">Friends page</a> if I get to know you.
            </p>
            <p>Love y'all,</p>
