                Every time I try to get my life "together" it's because I see all these productivity 
                people online saying they have all the answers and these few things will get your 
                life together. And then there are the productivity people online who say "screw 
                what all of those productivity people online say" and then tell you the same thing 
                as those productivity online but with a different filter.

                While the content in their videos may have not taught me anything no matter how many 
                of them I have seen over the last few years, they definitely have taught me something: 
                the hardest part of doing anything is starting it.

                Yes that's corny I get it and it's not a novel take either but idk it is true for me and 
                if pisses me off so much. I have so many cool ideas I want to do and I never follow through 
                with them because I always psych myself out before I even get started with them. This 
                website is one of the only things in a long time that I actually decided on and have not 
                entirely abandoned already. I'm always in a state of paralysis where I don't think I'm 
                going to be able to complete something or complete it well. It's not even impostor syndrome 
                either that's when you're already doing a good job and feel like you aren't. Half of the 
                time I'm not doing a job at all and I feel like that might be significantly worse.

                The most interesting part is that once I do start something I usually surprise myself with 
                how capable I am of completing it. For example I made a script for this website in Ruby 
                that would update all of the navigation pages whenever I added a post. It worked but it 
                sucked and was ugly because it was my first Ruby program. I then decided I wanted to refactor 
                it to make it better but this time instead of refactoring in Ruby (which would not take me 
                long at all), I decided I wanted to rewrite the program in C. This took me longer but felt 
                like I was doing more, especially because I was already somewhat familiar with the language.

                It had some issues with cross platform inconsistencies, and there was a simple fix. In my head 
                I knew it was simple! But it took me three days from the time that I realized the issue, to the 
                time that I actually went to solve it. The solution took me 15 minutes or less once I got to 
                working on it, which is great! Great except for the fact that I took 3 days and 15 minutes to 
                code a 15 minute solution.

                This is obviously just one situation and sounds like procrastination, but I am also a 
                procrastinator and this is not the same feeling. When I procrastinate, I have a deadline and 
                I KNOW for a fact I'm going to make it before the deadline. If I'm procrastinating it's because 
                I'm confident in my abilities and want to free up time elsewhere and only work on that task 
                when I need to. This is different it's like the opposite feeling but with the same consequence. 
                I am not at all confident in my abilities even though I should be, and I have plenty of time to 
                complete the task, but I push it off for seemingly no reason.

                I'm sure there's some reason for all of this, but I don't really care what the reason is 
                anymore because posting this blog is basically my solution to it. I can buy as many notebooks 
                as I want, try to schedule my life as much as I want, and read all the improvement slop in the 
                world, but I think posting this is probably going to be the biggest impact on my entire life 
                in terms of getting things done, because it is taking care of the hardest part for me.
