            <p>Fuck my life. Charlie Kirk is on campus setting up a table and 
			wearing a hat and cherry picking statistics again.</p>
			<p>This wouldn't matter to me if I didn't have an exam today and 
			he wasn't setting up his ego farm right next to my classroom, 
			which also happens to be right next to the place I usually go to 
			study.</p>
			<p>I was gonna bring my camera today to get at least something out 
			of it, maybe a couple funny pictures to post online or even share 
			here. Sadly, I forgot about it and didn't remember to pack it when 
			I left. I can take a picture with my phone I guess but it's not as 
			cool or funny as pulling out an entire DSLR to get a picture of 
			Charlie Kirk smiling while he argues with someone who had zero time 
			to prepare their argument and cryptobros gather around in flocks to 
			post "ULTIMATE LIBERAL MORON GETS OWNED BY FACTS" on their Instagram 
			stories that nobody is looking at.</p>
			<p>Anyways, I'll probably be fine. The exam shouldn't be too hard and 
			if it is it's not like it's worth a huge portion of my grade.</p>
			<p>Love y'all,</p>
